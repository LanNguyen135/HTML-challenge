### Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

- I utilized the Splinter library for automated web browsing to visit the Mars news website.
- I extracted titles and preview text of the Mars news articles from the HTML code of the webpage using Beautiful Soup.

### Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

Data Extraction and Transformation

- I employed Splinter and Beautiful Soup to scrape the Mars weather data from the webpage.
- The data was structured into a Pandas DataFrame with appropriate column headings and data types.

Data Analysis

I conducted several analyses on the scraped Mars weather data to answer key questions and created data visualizations to support findings.
The data was analyzed to answer the following questions:
- How many months exist on Mars? 
- How many Martian days' worth of data are there? 
- Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?
- Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?
- How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year?

Data Export

The final DataFrame was exported into a CSV file for further use.
